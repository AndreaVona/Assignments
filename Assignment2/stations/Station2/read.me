# What I implemented
You can find my work in the directory /RIOT/examples/station-file (which is the same for both stations, besides minor changes). It is a modified version of RIOT's "em_cutte" folder's content downloadable from RIOT official git repository.

# Disclaimer 
I do not own anything else. The rest of the files are RIOT's.
